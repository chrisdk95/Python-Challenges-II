"""
range has been modified in order to start at the last index of the string (length of the string minus one) up to the first index. Since the parameter for the ending index is exclusive we need to provide the index of one more iteration than what we want to stop at. We want to stop at 0, and since we are incrementing by -1, we will set the ending index to -1. Finally, make sure to add the third parameter of -1. This makes us increment by -1 at each step.
